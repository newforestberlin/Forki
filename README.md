# Forki - The omnidirectional autonomous driving robot
![Forki](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newforestberlin/Forki/master/forki.jpeg)

The goal of Forki is to advance the development of software for real industrial robots. Thatâ€™s why we document and opensource the entire project to give others the opportunity to rebuild forki and become a part of the robotics community themselves and share knowledge.

# Software architecture
![architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newforestberlin/Forki/master/architecture.png)

# Setup Raspberry Pi

## Option 1: Use our Raspberry Pi image
The advantage is that you don't have to install anything anymore and the software starts automatically when you boot the Raspberry Pi.
(comming soon)

## Option 2: Install everything by your own

### Install redis
`https://habilisbest.com/install-redis-on-your-raspberryp`

### Install Node
`https://www.instructables.com/id/Install-Nodejs-and-Npm-on-Raspberry-Pi/`

### Set up backend on the Raspberry Pi
```
git clone https://github.com/newforestberlin/Forki.git
cd ./raspberry_pi
npm install --prefix ./backend
```

You need to edit the .env.example, rename it to .env and place the IP of your local machine in the IOT_PLATFORM_URL variable. Then you can start the sensors and the app:

```
./run.sh
```

# Setup Frontend and Backend (IoT Platform) on your local machine
## Option 1: Set up with [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac) (recommended)

```
git clone https://github.com/newforestberlin/Forki.git
```

You need to edit the ./backend/.env.example, rename it to .env and place the IP of the Raspberry Pi in the RASPBERRY_PI_URL variable. Then you can start the frontend and backend on your local machine:

```
docker-compose up
```

## Option 2: Install everything directly on your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/newforestberlin/Forki.git
npm install --prefix ./frontend && npm install --prefix ./backend
```

You need to edit the ./backend/.env.example, rename it to .env and place the IP of the Raspberry Pi in the RASPBERRY_PI_URL variable. Then you can start the frontend and backend on your local machine:

```
npm start --prefix ./backend
npm start --prefix ./frontend
```

# Additional: Setup remote connection to the Raspberry Pi with vscode
### Install rmate with this guide
`https://medium.com/@prtdomingo/editing-files-in-your-linux-virtual-machine-made-a-lot-easier-with-remote-vscode-6bb98d0639a4`

### If connection refused error
`https://askubuntu.com/questions/218344/why-am-i-getting-a-port-22-connection-refused-error`

### log into the raspberry and get the IP adress
`ifconfig`

### Connect to Raspberry Pi
`ssh -R 52698:127.0.0.1:52698 pi@192.168.2.67`
Replace the IP with the right one
